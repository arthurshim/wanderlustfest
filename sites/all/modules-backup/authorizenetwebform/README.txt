Description:
------------
This module extends the webform module to easily allow submitting a webform 
payment through Authorize.Net.  The module does require PHP to be built
with CURL enabled in order to use Authorize.Net's AIM interface.

If you are having issues with blank screens or errors on form submissions,
as a first troubleshooting step, make sure you have entered the correct
API ID and Transaction Key (NOT your username or password), and that you
followed all of the instructions in INSTALL.txt.
